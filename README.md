# Hi 👋, I'm Nav  

### Aspiring Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | TEDx Speaker (in progress)

I am a **self-driven Data Science learner** focused on building strong fundamentals through  
**real-world projects, structured methodologies, and continuous improvement**.

I believe in **learning in public**, documenting my journey, and improving by feedback.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Currently Doing

- 📊 Building **small, focused Data Science projects** to master core concepts  
- 🧠 Applying **CRISP-DM** methodology for structured problem-solving and also make use of cookie cutter structure
- 🐍 Deepening my understanding of **Python, Pandas, and Machine Learning**  
- 🎤 Practicing communication daily to grow as a **future TEDx speaker**  
- 📺 Sharing my learning journey through **YouTube & GitHub**

---

## 👨‍💻 Projects & Learning

- 🔍 Data Understanding & Exploratory Data Analysis  
- 🧪 Feature Engineering & Experiments  
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models (Scikit-learn)  
- 📈 Data Visualization & Insights  
- 🏥 Real-world datasets (Healthcare, Finance, etc.)

👉 All projects are built **step by step**, focusing on *clarity over complexity*.

## 🌱 Learning Philosophy

> “Small projects. Honest mistakes. Continuous improvement.”

- Start small  
- Document everything  
- Improve incrementally  
- Learn from feedback  
- Build consistency over perfection  

This profile reflects **growth**, not just results.
