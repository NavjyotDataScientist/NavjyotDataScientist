# Hi 👋, I'm Nav  

### Aspiring Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer & AI | TEDx Speaker | English Learner

👉 These projects are **not perfect** — and that’s intentional 

“You don’t learn by being perfect.  
You learn by improving what’s imperfect.”


If you spot a mistake or see a better way to do something — **that’s a win for learning** 💡 See only what good things you take out from my account and learn by this apporach and become what you want in your life
